We provide two  ```.py``` files, namely:
- ```implementations.py``` contains our implementations of the requested functions.
- ```functions.py``` contains other functions that are useful.

We then provide two ```.ipynb``` notebooks, namely:
- ```run.ipynb``` produces the submission that we intend to use.
- ```tuning.ipynb``` displays the plot that we showed in the report, and saves the parameters for the model that we run in ```run.ipynb```;
- ```data_cleaning.ipynb```, where we performed data cleaning.

To be able to load all the data, you should unzip the file ```data\dataset.zip``` in the ```data``` directory and the file ```new_data\cleaned_data.zip``` in the ```new_data``` folder.

The submission on AIcrowd that we reproduce with our ```run.ipynb``` notebook is that with 
- ID: 275515

We apologize for pushing out last commit too late (~5h past the deadline). We sent an email to Corentin Dumery to give some context about our situation.

Since we are not able to modify the original repo for this project, we provide this new repo with all the files and the data needed for the project.
